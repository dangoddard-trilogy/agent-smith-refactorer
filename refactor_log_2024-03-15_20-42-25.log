2024-03-15 20:42:28,221 - INFO - AssistantManager: Refactoring prompt constructed: Please refactor the Java source code file identified by `file-6VvK3iMmJYrjGQU2wxUu0b8R`. Your primary task is to locate all occurrences of the deprecated class or method `ParameterizedBeanPropertyRowMapper` (it will likely be imported with full classpath as `org.springframework.jdbc.core.simple.ParameterizedBeanPropertyRowMapper`), then update these to their corresponding Spring 5.x equivalents. This task involves both direct and indirect usages within the code, and extends to updating necessary import statements. Don't do a text-based search and replace, as the string `ParameterizedBeanPropertyRowMapper` may also be contained as part of another class or method name that should not be changed as part of this scope (for example, if we are refactoring a class named ASpecialClass, we would not count a class named ThisIsASpecialClass as part of this refactoring, as it is a different class, even if it is related by name or function).

Identification: Search the entire file for any usage of `ParameterizedBeanPropertyRowMapper`. This includes class uses, class method calls and import statements. Count how many occurrences there are including the import statements.

Determine Spring 5.x Equivalents: For each identified instance, determine the correct refactoring for each use of `ParameterizedBeanPropertyRowMapper`. If unsure, use your best judgment based on Spring 5.x documentation and standards to select the most appropriate equivalent.

Execute Refactoring: Refactor each instance with the identified Spring 5.x equivalent. Ensure the replacement is done in a way that matches the original method's intent and functionality (don't change the logic).

Update Import Statements: Along with class or method refactoring, update any relevant import statements to reflect changes made to class or method usages. Remove any duplicate imports for `org.springframework.jdbc.core.simple.ParameterizedBeanPropertyRowMapper`

Preserve Code Integrity: Make all changes with care to maintain the original code's logic and functionality. The refactoring should solely focus on updating deprecated classes or methods to their new counterparts without altering other aspects of the code.

Comprehensive Review: After refactoring, review the code to ensure all instances of `ParameterizedBeanPropertyRowMapper` have been updated appropriately, and the code operates as expected with the new Spring 5.x class or method. Count how many occurrences of the new class or method, including import statements, and compare to the original count of `ParameterizedBeanPropertyRowMapper`. It should match, otherwise this is not a complete refactoring.

Proceed with these steps meticulously to ensure the code is modernized correctly, enhancing its compatibility with Spring 5.x while keeping its original functionality intact.

This task involves both direct and indirect usages within the code, and extends to updating necessary import statements.

Remove any duplicate imports for `{deprecated_method}`'}, {'step': 'Preserve Code Integrity', 'detail': "Make all changes with care to maintain the original code's logic and functionality. The refactoring should solely focus on updating deprecated classes or methods to their new counterparts without altering other aspects of the code."}, {'step': 'Comprehensive Review', 'detail': 'After refactoring, review the code to ensure all instances of `{shorthand_method_name}` have been updated appropriately, and the code operates as expected with the new Spring 5.x class or method.

2024-03-15 20:44:51,056 - INFO - AssistantManager: Refactoring prompt constructed: Please refactor the Java source code file identified by `file-fMdKJSbqpYUnnHPALhTwrXel`. Your primary task is to locate all occurrences of the deprecated class or method `ParameterizedRowMapper` (it will likely be imported with full classpath as `org.springframework.jdbc.core.simple.ParameterizedRowMapper`), then update these to their corresponding Spring 5.x equivalents. This task involves both direct and indirect usages within the code, and extends to updating necessary import statements. Don't do a text-based search and replace, as the string `ParameterizedRowMapper` may also be contained as part of another class or method name that should not be changed as part of this scope (for example, if we are refactoring a class named ASpecialClass, we would not count a class named ThisIsASpecialClass as part of this refactoring, as it is a different class, even if it is related by name or function).

Identification: Search the entire file for any usage of `ParameterizedRowMapper`. This includes class uses, class method calls and import statements. Count how many occurrences there are including the import statements.

Determine Spring 5.x Equivalents: For each identified instance, determine the correct refactoring for each use of `ParameterizedRowMapper`. If unsure, use your best judgment based on Spring 5.x documentation and standards to select the most appropriate equivalent.

Execute Refactoring: Refactor each instance with the identified Spring 5.x equivalent. Ensure the replacement is done in a way that matches the original method's intent and functionality (don't change the logic).

Update Import Statements: Along with class or method refactoring, update any relevant import statements to reflect changes made to class or method usages. Remove any duplicate imports for `org.springframework.jdbc.core.simple.ParameterizedRowMapper`

Preserve Code Integrity: Make all changes with care to maintain the original code's logic and functionality. The refactoring should solely focus on updating deprecated classes or methods to their new counterparts without altering other aspects of the code.

Comprehensive Review: After refactoring, review the code to ensure all instances of `ParameterizedRowMapper` have been updated appropriately, and the code operates as expected with the new Spring 5.x class or method. Count how many occurrences of the new class or method, including import statements, and compare to the original count of `ParameterizedRowMapper`. It should match, otherwise this is not a complete refactoring.

Proceed with these steps meticulously to ensure the code is modernized correctly, enhancing its compatibility with Spring 5.x while keeping its original functionality intact.

2024-03-15 20:45:43,924 - INFO - AssistantManager: Refactoring prompt constructed: Please refactor the Java source code file identified by `file-1vaqPkvvHqwBVG1HjVM9W3TK`. Your primary task is to locate all occurrences of the deprecated class or method `ParameterizedRowMapper` (it will likely be imported with full classpath as `org.springframework.jdbc.core.simple.ParameterizedRowMapper`), then update these to their corresponding Spring 5.x equivalents. This task involves both direct and indirect usages within the code, and extends to updating necessary import statements. Don't do a text-based search and replace, as the string `ParameterizedRowMapper` may also be contained as part of another class or method name that should not be changed as part of this scope (for example, if we are refactoring a class named ASpecialClass, we would not count a class named ThisIsASpecialClass as part of this refactoring, as it is a different class, even if it is related by name or function).

Identification: Search the entire file for any usage of `ParameterizedRowMapper`. This includes class uses, class method calls and import statements. Count how many occurrences there are including the import statements.

Determine Spring 5.x Equivalents: For each identified instance, determine the correct refactoring for each use of `ParameterizedRowMapper`. If unsure, use your best judgment based on Spring 5.x documentation and standards to select the most appropriate equivalent.

Execute Refactoring: Refactor each instance with the identified Spring 5.x equivalent. Ensure the replacement is done in a way that matches the original method's intent and functionality (don't change the logic).

Update Import Statements: Along with class or method refactoring, update any relevant import statements to reflect changes made to class or method usages. Remove any duplicate imports for `org.springframework.jdbc.core.simple.ParameterizedRowMapper`

Preserve Code Integrity: Make all changes with care to maintain the original code's logic and functionality. The refactoring should solely focus on updating deprecated classes or methods to their new counterparts without altering other aspects of the code.

Comprehensive Review: After refactoring, review the code to ensure all instances of `ParameterizedRowMapper` have been updated appropriately, and the code operates as expected with the new Spring 5.x class or method. Count how many occurrences of the new class or method, including import statements, and compare to the original count of `ParameterizedRowMapper`. It should match, otherwise this is not a complete refactoring.

Proceed with these steps meticulously to ensure the code is modernized correctly, enhancing its compatibility with Spring 5.x while keeping its original functionality intact.

Your primary task is to locate all occurrences of the deprecated class or method `ParameterizedRowMapper` (it will likely be imported with full classpath as `org.springframework.jdbc.core.simple.ParameterizedRowMapper`), then update these to their corresponding Spring 5.x equivalents. This task involves both direct and indirect usages within the code, and extends to updating necessary import statements.

Identification: Search the entire file for any usage of `ParameterizedRowMapper`. This includes class uses, class method calls and import statements. Count how many occurrences there are including the import statements.

Determine Spring 5.x Equivalents: For each identified instance, determine the correct refactoring for each use of `ParameterizedRowMapper`. If unsure, use your best judgment based on Spring 5.x documentation and standards to select the most appropriate equivalent.

Execute Refactoring: Refactor each instance with the identified Spring 5.x equivalent. Ensure the replacement is done in a way that matches the original method's intent and functionality (don't change the logic).

Update Import Statements: Along with class or method refactoring, update any relevant import statements to reflect changes made to class or method usages. Remove any duplicate imports for `org.springframework.jdbc.core.simple.ParameterizedRowMapper`

Preserve Code Integrity: Make all changes with care to maintain the original code's logic and functionality. The refactoring should solely focus on updating deprecated classes or methods to their new counterparts without altering other aspects of the code.

Comprehensive Review: After refactoring, review the code to ensure all instances of `ParameterizedRowMapper` have been updated appropriately, and the code operates as expected with the new Spring 5.x class or method. Count how many occurrences of the new class or method, including import statements, and compare to the original count of `ParameterizedRowMapper`. It should match, otherwise this is not a complete refactoring.

Proceed with these steps meticulously to ensure the code is modernized correctly, enhancing its compatibility with Spring 5.x while keeping its original functionality intact.
