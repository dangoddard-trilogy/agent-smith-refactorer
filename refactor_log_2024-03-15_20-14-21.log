2024-03-15 20:14:23,339 - INFO - AssistantManager: Refactoring prompt constructed: Please refactor the Java source code file identified by `file-CbXS00kd3jSP8nG4JPpgY684`. Your primary task is to locate all occurrences of the deprecated class or method `org.springframework.jdbc.core.simple.ParameterizedBeanPropertyRowMapper` and its shorthand usage `ParameterizedBeanPropertyRowMapper`, then update these to their corresponding Spring 5.x equivalents. This task involves both direct and indirect usages within the code, and extends to updating necessary import statements.

Identification: Search the entire file for any usage of `org.springframework.jdbc.core.simple.ParameterizedBeanPropertyRowMapper` and `ParameterizedBeanPropertyRowMapper`. This includes direct method calls and import statements. Count how many occurrences there are including the import statements.

Determine Spring 5.x Equivalents: For each identified instance, determine the updated class or method in Spring 5.x that replaces `org.springframework.jdbc.core.simple.ParameterizedBeanPropertyRowMapper`. If unsure, use your best judgment based on Spring 5.x documentation and standards to select the most appropriate equivalent.

Execute Refactoring: Replace each deprecated class or method usage with the identified Spring 5.x equivalent. Ensure the replacement is done in a way that matches the original method's intent and functionality.

Update Import Statements: Along with class or method replacements, update any relevant import statements to reflect changes made to class or method usages.

Preserve Code Integrity: Make all changes with care to maintain the original code's logic and functionality. The refactoring should solely focus on updating deprecated classes or methods to their new counterparts without altering other aspects of the code.

Comprehensive Review: After refactoring, review the code to ensure all instances of `ParameterizedBeanPropertyRowMapper` have been updated appropriately, and the code operates as expected with the new Spring 5.x classes or methods. Count how many occurrences of the new class or method, including import statements, and compare to the original count (from the deprecated class or method). It should match, otherwise this is not a complete refactoring.

Proceed with these steps meticulously to ensure the code is modernized correctly, enhancing its compatibility with Spring 5.x while keeping its original functionality intact.

2024-03-15 20:15:53,615 - INFO - AssistantManager: Refactoring prompt constructed: Please refactor the Java source code file identified by `file-5Z0GkqdWCHGNHK8Gjx0wZon7`. Your primary task is to locate all occurrences of the deprecated class or method `org.springframework.jdbc.core.simple.ParameterizedRowMapper` and its shorthand usage `ParameterizedRowMapper`, then update these to their corresponding Spring 5.x equivalents. This task involves both direct and indirect usages within the code, and extends to updating necessary import statements.

Identification: Search the entire file for any usage of `org.springframework.jdbc.core.simple.ParameterizedRowMapper` and `ParameterizedRowMapper`. This includes direct method calls and import statements. Count how many occurrences there are including the import statements.

Determine Spring 5.x Equivalents: For each identified instance, determine the updated class or method in Spring 5.x that replaces `org.springframework.jdbc.core.simple.ParameterizedRowMapper`. If unsure, use your best judgment based on Spring 5.x documentation and standards to select the most appropriate equivalent.

Execute Refactoring: Replace each deprecated class or method usage with the identified Spring 5.x equivalent. Ensure the replacement is done in a way that matches the original method's intent and functionality.

Update Import Statements: Along with class or method replacements, update any relevant import statements to reflect changes made to class or method usages.

Preserve Code Integrity: Make all changes with care to maintain the original code's logic and functionality. The refactoring should solely focus on updating deprecated classes or methods to their new counterparts without altering other aspects of the code.

Comprehensive Review: After refactoring, review the code to ensure all instances of `ParameterizedRowMapper` have been updated appropriately, and the code operates as expected with the new Spring 5.x classes or methods. Count how many occurrences of the new class or method, including import statements, and compare to the original count (from the deprecated class or method). It should match, otherwise this is not a complete refactoring.

Proceed with these steps meticulously to ensure the code is modernized correctly, enhancing its compatibility with Spring 5.x while keeping its original functionality intact.

2024-03-15 20:16:51,954 - INFO - AssistantManager: Refactoring prompt constructed: Please refactor the Java source code file identified by `file-5Z0GkqdWCHGNHK8Gjx0wZon7`. Your primary task is to locate all occurrences of the deprecated class or method `org.springframework.jdbc.core.simple.ParameterizedRowMapper` and its shorthand usage `ParameterizedRowMapper`, then update these to their corresponding Spring 5.x equivalents. This task involves both direct and indirect usages within the code, and extends to updating necessary import statements.

Identification: Search the entire file for any usage of `org.springframework.jdbc.core.simple.ParameterizedRowMapper` and `ParameterizedRowMapper`. This includes direct method calls and import statements. Count how many occurrences there are including the import statements.

Determine Spring 5.x Equivalents: For each identified instance, determine the updated class or method in Spring 5.x that replaces `org.springframework.jdbc.core.simple.ParameterizedRowMapper`. If unsure, use your best judgment based on Spring 5.x documentation and standards to select the most appropriate equivalent.

Execute Refactoring: Replace each deprecated class or method usage with the identified Spring 5.x equivalent. Ensure the replacement is done in a way that matches the original method's intent and functionality.

Update Import Statements: Along with class or method replacements, update any relevant import statements to reflect changes made to class or method usages.

Preserve Code Integrity: Make all changes with care to maintain the original code's logic and functionality. The refactoring should solely focus on updating deprecated classes or methods to their new counterparts without altering other aspects of the code.

Comprehensive Review: After refactoring, review the code to ensure all instances of `ParameterizedRowMapper` have been updated appropriately, and the code operates as expected with the new Spring 5.x classes or methods. Count how many occurrences of the new class or method, including import statements, and compare to the original count (from the deprecated class or method). It should match, otherwise this is not a complete refactoring.

Proceed with these steps meticulously to ensure the code is modernized correctly, enhancing its compatibility with Spring 5.x while keeping its original functionality intact.

2024-03-15 20:17:33,492 - INFO - AssistantManager: Refactoring prompt constructed: Please refactor the Java source code file identified by `file-5Z0GkqdWCHGNHK8Gjx0wZon7`. Your primary task is to locate all occurrences of the deprecated class or method `org.springframework.jdbc.core.simple.ParameterizedRowMapper` and its shorthand usage `ParameterizedRowMapper`, then update these to their corresponding Spring 5.x equivalents. This task involves both direct and indirect usages within the code, and extends to updating necessary import statements.

Identification: Search the entire file for any usage of `org.springframework.jdbc.core.simple.ParameterizedRowMapper` and `ParameterizedRowMapper`. This includes direct method calls and import statements. Count how many occurrences there are including the import statements.

Determine Spring 5.x Equivalents: For each identified instance, determine the updated class or method in Spring 5.x that replaces `org.springframework.jdbc.core.simple.ParameterizedRowMapper`. If unsure, use your best judgment based on Spring 5.x documentation and standards to select the most appropriate equivalent.

Execute Refactoring: Replace each deprecated class or method usage with the identified Spring 5.x equivalent. Ensure the replacement is done in a way that matches the original method's intent and functionality.

Update Import Statements: Along with class or method replacements, update any relevant import statements to reflect changes made to class or method usages.

Preserve Code Integrity: Make all changes with care to maintain the original code's logic and functionality. The refactoring should solely focus on updating deprecated classes or methods to their new counterparts without altering other aspects of the code.

Comprehensive Review: After refactoring, review the code to ensure all instances of `ParameterizedRowMapper` have been updated appropriately, and the code operates as expected with the new Spring 5.x classes or methods. Count how many occurrences of the new class or method, including import statements, and compare to the original count (from the deprecated class or method). It should match, otherwise this is not a complete refactoring.

Proceed with these steps meticulously to ensure the code is modernized correctly, enhancing its compatibility with Spring 5.x while keeping its original functionality intact.

2024-03-15 20:19:10,404 - INFO - AssistantManager: Refactoring prompt constructed: Please refactor the Java source code file identified by `file-5Z0GkqdWCHGNHK8Gjx0wZon7`. Your primary task is to locate all occurrences of the deprecated class or method `org.springframework.jdbc.core.simple.ParameterizedRowMapper` and its shorthand usage `ParameterizedRowMapper`, then update these to their corresponding Spring 5.x equivalents. This task involves both direct and indirect usages within the code, and extends to updating necessary import statements.

Identification: Search the entire file for any usage of `org.springframework.jdbc.core.simple.ParameterizedRowMapper` and `ParameterizedRowMapper`. This includes direct method calls and import statements. Count how many occurrences there are including the import statements.

Determine Spring 5.x Equivalents: For each identified instance, determine the updated class or method in Spring 5.x that replaces `org.springframework.jdbc.core.simple.ParameterizedRowMapper`. If unsure, use your best judgment based on Spring 5.x documentation and standards to select the most appropriate equivalent.

Execute Refactoring: Replace each deprecated class or method usage with the identified Spring 5.x equivalent. Ensure the replacement is done in a way that matches the original method's intent and functionality.

Update Import Statements: Along with class or method replacements, update any relevant import statements to reflect changes made to class or method usages.

Preserve Code Integrity: Make all changes with care to maintain the original code's logic and functionality. The refactoring should solely focus on updating deprecated classes or methods to their new counterparts without altering other aspects of the code.

Comprehensive Review: After refactoring, review the code to ensure all instances of `ParameterizedRowMapper` have been updated appropriately, and the code operates as expected with the new Spring 5.x classes or methods. Count how many occurrences of the new class or method, including import statements, and compare to the original count (from the deprecated class or method). It should match, otherwise this is not a complete refactoring.

Proceed with these steps meticulously to ensure the code is modernized correctly, enhancing its compatibility with Spring 5.x while keeping its original functionality intact.

2024-03-15 20:20:09,915 - INFO - AssistantManager: Starting refactoring process...
2024-03-15 20:20:09,915 - INFO - AssistantManager: Refactoring prompt constructed: Please refactor the Java source code file identified by `file-7na1q2OdrQxtwlJcZenE28h7`. Your primary task is to locate all occurrences of the deprecated class or method `org.springframework.jdbc.core.simple.ParameterizedRowMapper` and its shorthand usage `ParameterizedRowMapper`, then update these to their corresponding Spring 5.x equivalents. This task involves both direct and indirect usages within the code, and extends to updating necessary import statements.

Identification: Search the entire file for any usage of `org.springframework.jdbc.core.simple.ParameterizedRowMapper` and `ParameterizedRowMapper`. This includes direct method calls and import statements. Count how many occurrences there are including the import statements.

Determine Spring 5.x Equivalents: For each identified instance, determine the updated class or method in Spring 5.x that replaces `org.springframework.jdbc.core.simple.ParameterizedRowMapper`. If unsure, use your best judgment based on Spring 5.x documentation and standards to select the most appropriate equivalent.

Execute Refactoring: Replace each deprecated class or method usage with the identified Spring 5.x equivalent. Ensure the replacement is done in a way that matches the original method's intent and functionality.

Update Import Statements: Along with class or method replacements, update any relevant import statements to reflect changes made to class or method usages.

Preserve Code Integrity: Make all changes with care to maintain the original code's logic and functionality. The refactoring should solely focus on updating deprecated classes or methods to their new counterparts without altering other aspects of the code.

Comprehensive Review: After refactoring, review the code to ensure all instances of `ParameterizedRowMapper` have been updated appropriately, and the code operates as expected with the new Spring 5.x classes or methods. Count how many occurrences of the new class or method, including import statements, and compare to the original count (from the deprecated class or method). It should match, otherwise this is not a complete refactoring.

Proceed with these steps meticulously to ensure the code is modernized correctly, enhancing its compatibility with Spring 5.x while keeping its original functionality intact.
