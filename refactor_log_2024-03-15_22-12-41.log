Please refactor again and create a new file_id and link in your response.` Refactor the Java code in `file-QXyqV5NwoPEnxf4Iss1WsUuo` by updating deprecated `ParameterizedRowMapper` (imported as `org.springframework.jdbc.core.simple.ParameterizedRowMapper`) to their Spring 5.x equivalents. Ensure changes are precise, avoiding alterations to unrelated class/method names and preserving original code functionality.

Identify Deprecated Usage: Find all occurrences of `ParameterizedRowMapper`, excluding imports. Document the count as `original_count`.

Plan Refactoring: For each occurrence, determine the Spring 5.x replacement.

Execute Refactoring: Replace deprecated usage with Spring 5.x equivalents, excluding related imports.

Review and Verify: Ensure all instances (excluding imports) are updated and the refactored code functions as intended. Verify the count of updated instances matches `original_count`. Finally, ensure imports are updated to match the changes.
